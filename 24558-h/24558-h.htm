<p>&#9632; Uncle William Boles' war-battered
old Geest gun gave the impression
that at some stage of its construction
it had been pulled out of shape and
then hardened in that form. What
remained of it was all of one piece.
The scarred and pitted twin barrels
were stubby and thick, and the vacant
oblong in the frame behind them
might have contained standard energy
magazines. It was the stock
which gave the alien weapon its curious
appearance. Almost eighteen
inches long, it curved abruptly to the
right and was too thin, knobbed and
indented to fit comfortably at any
point in a human hand. Over half a
century had passed since, with the
webbed, boneless fingers of its original
owner closed about it, it last spat
deadly radiation at human foemen.
Now it hung among Uncle William's
other collected oddities on the wall
above the living room fireplace.</p>

<p>And today, Phil Boles thought,
squinting at the gun with reflectively
narrowed eyes, some eight years after
Uncle William's death, the old war
souvenir would quietly become a key
factor in the solution of a colonial
planet's problems. He ran a finger
over the dull, roughened frame, bent
closer to study the neatly lettered inscription:
GUNDERLAND BATTLE
TROPHY, ANNO 2172, SGT.
WILLIAM G. BOLES. Then, catching
a familiar series of clicking noises
from the hall, he straightened quickly
and turned away. When Aunt Beulah's
go-chair came rolling back into
the room, Phil was sitting at the low
tea table, his back to the fireplace.</p>

<p>The go-chair's wide flexible treads
carried it smoothly down the three
steps to the sunken section of the
living room, Beulah sitting jauntily
erect in it, for all the ninety-six years
which had left her the last survivor of
the original group of Earth settlers on
the world of Roye. She tapped her
fingers here and there on the chair's
armrests, swinging it deftly about,
and brought it to a stop beside the
tea table.</p>

<p>"That was Susan Feeney calling,"
she reported. "And <i>there</i> is somebody
else for you who thinks I have to be
taken care of! Go ahead and finish
the pie, Phil. Can't hurt a husky man
like you. Got a couple more baking
for you to take along."</p>

<p>Phil grinned. "That'd be worth the
trip up from Fort Roye all by itself."</p>

<p>Beulah looked pleased. "Not much
else I can do for my great-grand
nephew nowadays, is there?"</p>

<p>Phil said, after a moment, "Have
you given any further thought to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Moving down to Fort Roye?" Beulah
pursed her thin lips. "Goodness,
Phil, I do hate to disappoint you
again, but I'd be completely out of
place in a town apartment."</p>

<p>"Dr. Fitzsimmons would be
pleased," Phil remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, him! Fitz is another old worry
wart. What he wants is to get me
into the hospital. Nothing doing!"</p>

<p>Phil shook his head helplessly,
laughed. "After all, working a tupa
ranch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense. The ranch is just
enough bother to be interesting. The
appliances do everything anyway, and
Susan is down here every morning for
a chat and to make sure I'm still all
right. She won't admit that, of course,
but if she thinks something should be
taken care of, the whole Feeney family
shows up an hour later to do it.
There's really no reason for you to be
sending a dozen men up from Fort
Roye every two months to harvest the
tupa."</p>

<p>Phil shrugged. "No one's ever yet
invented an easy way to dig up those
roots. And the CLU's glad to furnish
the men."</p>

<p>"Because you're its president?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh."</p>

<p>"It really doesn't cost you anything?"
Beulah asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Not a cent."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Hm-m-m. Been meaning to ask
you. What made you set up that ...
Colonial Labor Union?"</p>

<p>Phil nodded. "That's the official
name."</p>

<p>"Why did you set it up in the first
place?"</p>

<p>"That's easy to answer," Phil said.
"On the day the planetary population
here touched the forty thousand
mark, Roye became legally entitled to
its labor union. Why not take advantage
of it?"</p>

<p>"What's the advantage?"</p>

<p>"More Earth money coming in, for
one thing. Of the twelve hundred
CLU members we've got in Fort Roye
now, seventy-six per cent were unemployed
this month. We'll have a
compensation check from the Territorial
Office with the next ship coming
in." He smiled at her expression.
"Sure, the boys <i>could</i> go back to the
tupa ranches. But not everyone likes
that life as well as you and the Feeneys."</p>

<p>"Earth government lets you get
away with it?" Beulah asked curiously.
"They used to be pretty tight-fisted."</p>

<p>"They still are&mdash;but it's the law.
The Territorial Office also pays any
CLU president's salary, incidentally.
I don't draw too much at the moment,
but that will go up automatically with
the membership and my responsibilities."</p>

<p>"What responsibilities?"</p>

<p>"We've set up a skeleton organization,"
Phil explained. "Now, when
Earth government decides eventually
to establish a big military base here,
they can run in a hundred thousand
civilians in a couple of months and
everyone will be fitted into the pattern
on Roye without trouble or confusion.
That's really the reason for all
the generosity."</p>

<p>Beulah sniffed. "Big base, my eye!
There hasn't been six months since I
set foot here that somebody wasn't
talking about Fort Roye being turned
into a Class A military base pretty
soon. It'll never happen, Phil. Roye's
a farm planet, and that's what it's
going to stay."</p>

<p>Phil's lips twitched. "Well, don't
give up hope."</p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> not anxious for any changes,"
Beulah said. "I like Roye the way it
is."</p>

<p>She peered at a button on the go-chair's
armrest which had just begun
to put out small bright-blue flashes of
light. "Pies are done," she announced.
"Phil, are you sure you can't stay for
dinner?"</p>

<p>Phil looked at his watch, shook his
head. "I'd love to, but I really have to
get back."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go wrap up the pies for
you."</p>

<p>Beulah swung the go-chair around,
sent it slithering up the stairs and out
the door. Phil stood up quickly. He
stepped over to the fireplace, opened
his coat and detached a flexible, box-shaped
object from the inner lining.
He laid this object on the mantle,
and turned one of three small knobs
about its front edge to the right. The
box promptly extruded a supporting
leg from each of its four corners,
pushed itself up from the mantle and
became a miniature table. Phil
glanced at the door through which
Beulah had vanished, listened a moment,
then took the Geest gun from
the wall, laid it carefully on top of
the device and twisted the second
dial.</p>

<p>The odd-looking gun began to sink
slowly down through the surface of
Phil's instrument, like a rock disappearing
in mud. Within seconds it
vanished completely; then, a moment
later, it began to emerge from the
box's underside. Phil let the Geest
gun drop into his hand, replaced it on
the wall, turned the third knob. The
box withdrew its supports and sank
down to the mantle. Phil clipped it
back inside his coat, closed the coat,
and strolled over to the center of the
room to wait for Aunt Beulah to return
with the pies.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">It was curious, Phil Boles reflected
as his aircar moved out over the craggy,
plunging coastline to the north
some while later, that a few bold
minds could be all that was needed
to change the fate of a world. A few
minds with imagination enough to
see how circumstances about them
might be altered.</p>

<p>On his left, far below, was now the
flat ribbon of the peninsula, almost at
sea level, its tip widening and lifting
into the broad, rocky promontory on
which stood Fort Roye&mdash;the only
thing on the planet bigger and of
more significance than the shabby
backwoods settlements. And Fort
Roye was neither very big nor very
significant. A Class F military base
around which, over the years, a straggling
town had come into existence,
Fort Roye was a space-age trading
post linking Roye's population to the
mighty mother planet, and a station
from which the otherwise vacant and
utterly unimportant 132nd Segment
of the Space Territories was periodically
and uneventfully patrolled. It
was no more than that. Twice a
month, an Earth ship settled down to
the tiny port, bringing supplies, purchases,
occasional groups of reassigned
military and civilians&mdash;the
latter suspected of being drawn as a
rule from Earth's Undesirable classification.
The ship would take off some
days later, with a return load of the
few local products for which there
was outside demand, primarily the
medically valuable tupa roots; and
Fort Roye lay quiet again.</p>

<p>The planet was not at fault. Essentially,
it had what was needed to become
a thriving colony in every sense.
At fault was the Geest War. The war
had periods of flare-up and periods
in which it seemed to be subsiding.
During the past decade it had been
subsiding again. One of the early
flare-ups, one of the worst, and the
one which brought the war closest to
Earth itself, was the Gunderland Battle
in which Uncle William Boles'
trophy gun had been acquired. But
the war never came near Roye. The
action was all in the opposite section
of the giant sphere of the Space Territories,
and over the years the war
drew steadily farther away.</p>

<p>And Earth's vast wealth&mdash;its manpower,
materials and money&mdash;was
pouring into space in the direction
the Geest War was moving. Worlds
not a tenth as naturally attractive as
Roye, worlds where the basic conditions
for human life were just above
the unbearable point, were settled and
held, equipped with everything needed
and wanted to turn them into independent
giant fortresses, with a
population not too dissatisfied with
its lot. When Earth government didn't
count the expense, life could be
made considerably better than bearable
almost anywhere.</p>

<p>Those were the circumstances
which condemned Roye to insignificance.
Not everyone minded. Phil
Boles, native son, did mind. His inclinations
were those of an operator,
and he was not being given an adequate
opportunity to exercise them.
Therefore, the circumstances would
have to be changed, and the precise
time to make the change was at hand.
Phil himself was not aware of every
factor involved, but he was aware of
enough of them. Back on Earth, a certain
political situation was edging
towards a specific point of instability.
As a result, an Earth ship which was
not one of the regular freighters had
put down at Fort Roye some days before.
Among its passengers were
Commissioner Sanford of the Territorial
Office, a well-known politician,
and a Mr. Ronald Black, the popular
and enterprising owner of Earth's
second largest news outlet system.
They were on a joint fact-finding tour
of the thinly scattered colonies in this
remote section of the Territories, and
had wound up eventually at the most
remote of all&mdash;the 132nd Segment
and Roye.</p>

<p>That was one factor. Just visible
twenty thousand feet below Phil&mdash;almost
directly beneath him now as
the aircar made its third leisurely
crossing of the central belt of the
peninsula&mdash;was another. From here it
looked like an irregular brown circle
against the peninsula's nearly white
ground. Lower down, it would have
resembled nothing so much as the
broken and half-decayed spirals of a
gigantic snail shell, its base sunk deep
in the ground and its shattered point
rearing twelve stories above it. This
structure, known popularly as "the
ruins" in Fort Roye, was supposed to
have been the last stronghold of a
semi-intelligent race native to Roye,
which might have become extinct
barely a century before the Earthmen
arrived. A factor associated with the
ruins again was that their investigation
was the passionately pursued
hobby of First Lieutenant Norman
Vaughn, Fort Roye's Science Officer.</p>

<p>Add to such things the reason Roye
was not considered in need of a serious
defensive effort by Earth's strategists&mdash;the
vast distances between it
and any troubled area, and so the utter
improbability that a Geest ship
might come close enough to discover
that here was another world as well
suited for its race as for human beings.
And then a final factor: the instrument
attached to the lining of
Phil's coat&mdash;a very special "camera"
which now carried the contact impressions
made on it by Uncle William's
souvenir gun. Put 'em all together,
Phil thought cheerily, and
they spelled out interesting developments
on Roye in the very near future.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch again,
swung the aircar about and started
back inland. He passed presently
high above Aunt Beulah's tupa ranch
and that of the Feeney family two
miles farther up the mountain, turned
gradually to the east and twenty minutes
later was edging back down the
ranges to the coast. Here in a wild,
unfarmed region, perched at the edge
of a cliff dropping nearly nine hundred
feet to the swirling tide, was a
small, trim cabin which was the property
of a small, trim Fort Roye lady
named Celia Adams. Celia had been
shipped out from Earth six years before,
almost certainly as an Undesirable,
though only the Territorial Office
and Celia herself knew about that, the
Botany Bay aspect of worlds like Roye
being handled with some tact by
Earth.</p>

<hr />

<p>Phil approached the cabin only as
far as was necessary to make sure that
the dark-green aircar parked before it
was one belonging to Major Wayne
Jackson, the Administration Officer
and second in command at Fort Roye&mdash;another
native son and an old acquaintance.
He then turned away,
dropped to the woods ten miles south
and made a second inconspicuous approach
under cover of the trees. There
might be casual observers in the area,
and while his meeting with Jackson
and Celia Adams today revealed
nothing in itself, it would be better
if no one knew about it.</p>

<p>He grounded the car in the forest
a few hundred yards from the Adams
cabin, slung a rifle over his shoulder
and set off along a game path. It was
good hunting territory, and the rifle
would explain his presence if he ran
into somebody. When he came within
view of the cabin, he discovered Celia
and her visitor on the covered back
patio, drinks standing before them.
Jackson was in hunting clothes. Phil
remained quietly back among the
trees for some seconds watching the
two, aware of something like a last-minute
hesitancy. A number of things
passed slowly through his mind.</p>

<p>What they planned to do was no
small matter. It was a hoax which
should have far-reaching results, on a
gigantic scale. And if Earth government
realized it had been hoaxed, the
thing could become very unpleasant.
That tough-minded central bureaucracy
did not ordinarily bother to obtain
proof against those it suspected.
The suspicion was enough. Individuals
and groups whom the shadow of
doubt touched found themselves
shunted unobtrusively into some
backwater of existence and kept there.
It was supposed to be very difficult to
emerge from such a position again.</p>

<p>In the back of his mind, Phil had
been conscious of that, but it had
seemed an insignificant threat against
the excitement arising from the grandiose
impudence of the plan, the
perhaps rather small-boyish delight
at being able to put something over,
profitably, on the greatest power of
all. Even now it might have been only
a natural wariness that brought the
threat up for a final moment of reflection.
He didn't, of course, want to
incur Earth government's disapproval.
But why believe that he might? On
all Roye there would be only three
who knew&mdash;Wayne Jackson, Celia
Adams, and himself. All three would
benefit, each in a different way, and
all would be equally responsible for
the hoax. No chance of indiscretion
or belated qualms there. Their own
interest ruled it out in each case.</p>

<p>And from the other men now involved
there was as little danger of
betrayal. Their gain would be vastly
greater, but they had correspondingly
more to lose. They would take every
step required to insure their protection,
and in doing that they would
necessarily take the best of care of
Phil Boles.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"How did you ever get such a thing
smuggled in to Roye?" Phil asked.
He'd swallowed half the drink Celia
offered him at a gulp and now, a few
minutes later, he was experiencing
what might have been under different
circumstances a comfortable glow,
but which didn't entirely erase the
awareness of having committed himself
at this hour to an irrevocable line
of action.</p>

<p>Celia stroked a fluffy lock of red-brown
hair back from her forehead
and glanced over at him. She had a
narrow, pretty face, marred only by a
suggestion of hardness about the
mouth&mdash;which was a little more than
ordinarily noticeable just now. Phil
decided she felt something like his
own tensions, for identical reasons.
He was less certain about Major
Wayne Jackson, a big, loose-jointed
man with an easy-going smile and a
pleasantly self-assured voice. The
voice might be veering a trifle too far
to the hearty side; but that was all.</p>

<p>"I didn't," Celia said. "It belonged
to Frank. How he got it shipped in
with him&mdash;or after him&mdash;from Earth
I don't know. He never told me.
When he died a couple of years ago,
I took it over."</p>

<p>Phil gazed reflectively at the row
of unfamiliar instruments covering
half the table beside her. The "camera"
which had taken an imprint of
the Geest gun in Aunt Beulah's living
room went with that equipment and
had become an interior section of the
largest of the instruments. "What do
you call it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Celia looked irritated. Jackson
laughed, said, "Why not tell him?
Phil's feeling like we do&mdash;this is the
last chance to look everything over,
make sure nobody's slipped up, that
nothing can go wrong. Right, Phil?"</p>

<p>Phil nodded. "Something like that."</p>

<p>Celia chewed her lip. "All right,"
she said. "It doesn't matter, I suppose&mdash;compared
with the other." She
tapped one of the instruments. "The
set's called a duplicator. This one's
around sixty years old. They're classified
as a forgery device, and it's decidedly
illegal for a private person to
build one, own one, or use one."</p>

<p>"Why that?"</p>

<p>"Because forgery is ordinarily all
they're good for. Frank was one of the
best of the boys in that line before he
found he'd been put on an outtransfer
list."</p>

<p>Phil frowned. "But if it can duplicate
any manufactured object&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It can. At an average expense
around fifty times higher than it
would take to make an ordinary reproduction
without it. A duplicator's
no use unless you want a reproduction
that's absolutely indistinguishable
from the model."</p>

<p>"I see." Phil was silent a moment.
"After sixty years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Phil," Jackson said.
"It's in perfect working condition.
We checked that on a number of
samples."</p>

<p>"How do you know the copies
were really indistinguishable?"</p>

<p>Celia said impatiently, "Because
that's the way the thing works. When
the Geest gun passed through the
model plate, it was analyzed down to
its last little molecule. The duplicate
is now being built up from that analysis.
Every fraction of every element
used in the original will show up
again exactly. Why do you think the
stuff's so expensive?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Phil grinned. "All right, I'm convinced.
How do we get rid of the inscription?"</p>

<p>"The gadget will handle that,"
Jackson said. "Crack that edge off,
treat the cracked surface to match the
wear of the rest." He smiled. "Makes
an Earth forger's life look easy, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It is till they hook you," Celia said
shortly. She finished her drink, set it
on the table, added, "We've a few
questions, too, Phil."</p>

<p>"The original gun," Jackson said.
"Mind you, there's no slightest reason
to expect an investigation. But after
this starts rolling, our necks will be
out just a little until we've got rid of
that particular bit of incriminating
evidence."</p>

<p>Phil pursed his lips. "I wouldn't
worry about it. Nobody but Beulah
ever looks at Uncle William's collection
of oddities. Most of it's complete
trash. And probably only she and you
and I know there's a Geest gun among
the things&mdash;William's cronies all
passed away before he did. But if the
gun disappeared now, Beulah would
miss it. And that&mdash;since Earth government's
made it illegal to possess
Geest artifacts&mdash;<i>might</i> create attention."</p>

<p>Jackson fingered his chin thoughtfully,
said, "Of course, there's always
a way to make sure Beulah didn't kick
up a fuss."</p>

<p>Phil hesitated. "Dr. Fitzsimmons
gives Beulah another three months at
the most," he said. "If she can stay out
of the hospital for even the next eight
weeks, he'll consider it some kind of
miracle. That should be early enough
to take care of the gun."</p>

<p>"It should be," Jackson said. "However,
if there does happen to be an
investigation before that time&mdash;"</p>

<p>Phil looked at him, said evenly,
"We'd do whatever was necessary. It
wouldn't be very agreeable, but my
neck's out just as far as yours."</p>

<p>Celia laughed. "That's the reason
we can all feel pretty safe," she observed.
"Every last one of us is completely
selfish&mdash;and there's no more
dependable kind of person than that."</p>

<p>Jackson flushed a little, glanced at
Phil, smiled. Phil shrugged. Major
Wayne Jackson, native son, Fort
Roye's second in command, was
scheduled for the number one spot
and a string of promotions via the
transfer of the current commander,
Colonel Thayer. Their Earthside associates
would arrange for that as soon
as the decision to turn Fort Roye
into a Class A military base was
reached. Phil himself could get by
with the guaranteed retention of the
CLU presidency, and a membership
moving up year by year to the half
million mark and beyond&mdash;he could
get by very, very comfortably, in fact.
While Celia Adams would develop a
discreetly firm hold on every upcoming
minor racket, facilitated by iron-clad
protection and an enforced lack
of all competitors.</p>

<p>"We're all thinking of Roye's future,
Celia," Phil said amiably, "each
in his own way. And the future looks
pretty bright. In fact, the only possible
stumbling block I can still see is right
here on Roye, and it's Honest Silas
Thayer. If our colonel covers up the
Geest gun find tomorrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jackson grinned, shook his head.
"Leave that to me, my boy&mdash;and to
our very distinguished visitors from
Earth. Commissioner Sanford has arranged
to be in Thayer's company on
Territorial Office business all day tomorrow.
Science Officer Vaughn is
dizzy with delight because Ronald
Black and most of the newsgathering
troop will inspect his diggings in the
ruins in the morning, with the promise
of giving his theories about the
vanished natives of Roye a nice
spread on Earth. Black will happen to
ask me to accompany the party. Between
Black and Sanford&mdash;and myself&mdash;Colonel
Silas Thayer won't
have a chance to suppress the discovery
of a Geest gun on Roye until the
military has had a chance to look into
it fully. And the only one he can possibly
blame for that will be Science
Officer Norm Vaughn&mdash;for whom, I'll
admit, I feel just a little bit sorry!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">First Lieutenant Norman Vaughn
was an intense and frustrated young
man whose unusually thick contact
lenses and wide mouth gave him
some resemblance to a melancholy
frog. He suspected, correctly, that a
good Science Officer would not have
been transferred from Earth to Roye
which was a planet deficient in scientific
problems of any magnitude, and
where requisitions for research purposes
were infrequently and grudgingly
granted.</p>

<p>The great spiraled ruin on the
peninsula of Fort Roye had been
Vaughn's one solace. Several similar
deserted structures were known to be
on the planet, but this was by far in
the best condition and no doubt the
most recently built. To him, if to no
one else, it became clear that the construction
had been carried out with
conscious plan and purpose, and he
gradually amassed great piles of notes
to back up his theory that the vanished
builders were of near-human intelligence.
Unfortunately, their bodies
appeared to have lacked hard and
durable parts, since nothing that
could be construed as their remains
was found; and what Lieutenant
Vaughn regarded as undeniable artifacts,
on the level of very early Man's
work, looked to others like chance
shards and lumps of the tough, shell-like
material of which the ruins were
composed.</p>

<p>Therefore, while Vaughn was&mdash;as
Jackson had pointed out&mdash;really
dizzy with delight when Ronald
Black, that giant of Earth's news media,
first indicated an interest in the
ruins and his theories about them,
this feeling soon became mixed with
acute anxiety. For such a chance
surely would not come again if the
visitors remained unconvinced by
what he showed them, and what&mdash;actually&mdash;did
he have to show? In the
morning, when the party set out,
Vaughn was in a noticeably nervous
frame of mind.</p>

<p>Two hours later, he burst into the
anteroom of the base commander's office
in Fort Roye, where the warrant
on duty almost failed to recognize
him. Lieutenant Vaughn's eyes glittered
through their thick lenses; his
face was red and he was grinning
from ear to ear. He pounded past the
startled warrant, pulled open the door
to the inner office where Colonel
Thayer sat with the visiting Territorial
Commissioner, and plunged inside.</p>

<p>"Sir," the warrant heard him quaver
breathlessly, "I have the proof&mdash;the
undeniable proof! They <i>were</i> intelligent
beings. They did <i>not</i> die of disease.
They were exterminated in war!
They were ... but see for yourself!"
There was a thud as he dropped
something on the polished table top
between the commissioner and Colonel
Thayer. "<i>That</i> was dug up just
now&mdash;among their own artifacts!"</p>

<p>Silas Thayer was on his feet, sucking
in his breath for the blast that
would hurl his blundering Science
Officer back out of the office. What
halted him was an odd, choked exclamation
from Commissioner Sanford.
The colonel's gaze flicked over to the
visitor, then followed Sanford's stare
to the object on the table.</p>

<p>For an instant, Colonel Thayer
froze.</p>

<p>Vaughn was bubbling on. "And,
sir, I ..."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" Thayer snapped. He
continued immediately, "You say this
was found in the diggings in the
ruins?"</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/002.png" width="388" height="550" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;just now! It's ..."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Vaughn checked himself
under the colonel's stare, some
dawning comprehension of the enormous
irregularities he'd committed
showing in his flushed face. He licked
his lips uncertainly.</p>

<p>"You will excuse me for a moment,
sir," Thayer said to Commissioner
Sanford. He picked the Geest
gun up gingerly by its unmistakably
curved shaft, took it over to the office
safe, laid it inside and relocked the
safe. He then left the office.</p>

<hr />

<p>In an adjoining room, Thayer
rapped out Major Wayne Jackson's
code number on a communicator. He
heard a faint click as Jackson's wrist
speaker switched on, and said quickly,
"Wayne, are you in a position to
speak?"</p>

<p>"I am at the moment," Jackson's
voice replied cautiously.</p>

<p>Colonel Thayer said, "Norm
Vaughn just crashed in here with
something he claims was found in the
diggings. Sanford saw it, and obviously
recognized it. We might be able to
keep him quiet. But now some questions.
Was that item actually dug up
just now?"</p>

<p>"Apparently it was," Jackson said.
"I didn't see it happen&mdash;I was talking
to Black at the moment. But there are
over a dozen witnesses who claim
they did see it happen, including five
or six of the news agency men."</p>

<p>"And they knew what it was?"</p>

<p>"Enough of them did."</p>

<p>Thayer cursed softly. "No chance
that one of them pitched the thing
into the diggings for an Earthside
sensation?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," Jackson said. "It
was lying in the sifter after most of
the sand and dust had been blown
away."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you call me at once?"</p>

<p>"I've been holding down something
like a mutiny here, Silas.
Vaughn got away before I could stop
him, but I grounded the other aircars
till you could decide what to do. Our
visitors don't like that. Neither do
they like the fact that I've put a guard
over the section where the find was
made, and haven't let them talk to
Norm's work crew.</p>

<p>"Ronald Black and his staff have
been fairly reasonable, but there's
been considerable mention of military
highhandedness made by the others.
This is the first moment I've been
free."</p>

<p>"You did the right thing," Thayer
said, "but I doubt it will help much
now. Can you get hold of Ronald
Black?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's over there ..."</p>

<p>"Colonel Thayer?" another voice
inquired pleasantly a few seconds
later.</p>

<p>"Mr. Black," the colonel said carefully,
"what occurred in the diggings
a short while ago may turn out to be
a matter of great importance."</p>

<p>"That's quite obvious, sir."</p>

<p>"And that being the case," the colonel
went on, "do you believe it would
be possible to obtain a gentleman's
agreement from all witnesses to make
no mention of this apparent discovery
until the information is released
through the proper channels? I'm asking
for your opinion."</p>

<p>"Colonel Thayer," Ronald Black's
voice said, still pleasantly, "my opinion
is that the only way you could
keep the matter quiet is to arrest every
civilian present, including myself,
and hold us incommunicado.
You have your duty, and we have ours.
Ours does not include withholding
information from the public which
may signal the greatest shift in the
conduct of the Geest War in the past
two decades."</p>

<p>"I understand," Thayer said. He
was silent for some seconds, and perhaps
he, too, was gazing during that
time at a Fort Roye of the future&mdash;a
Class A military base under his command,
with Earth's great war vessels
lined up along the length of the
peninsula.</p>

<p>"Mr. Black," he said, "please be so
good as to give your colleagues this
word from me. I shall make the most
thorough possible investigation of
what has occurred and forward a
prompt report, along with any material
evidence obtained, to my superiors
on Earth. None of you will receive
any other statement from me or
from anyone under my command. An
attempt to obtain such a statement
will, in fact, result in the arrest of the
person or persons involved. Is that
clear?"</p>

<p>"Quite clear, Colonel Thayer,"
Ronald Black said softly. "And entirely
satisfactory."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"We have known for the past eight
weeks," the man named Cranehart
said, "that this was not what it appears
to be ... that is, a section of
a Geest weapon."</p>

<p>He shoved the object in question
across the desk towards Commissioner
Sanford and Ronald Black. Neither of
the two attempted to pick it up; they
glanced at it, then returned their eyes
attentively to Cranehart's face.</p>

<p>"It is, of course, an excellent copy,"
Cranehart went on, "produced with a
professional forger's equipment. As I
imagine you're aware, that should
have made it impossible to distinguish
from the original weapon.
However ... there's no real harm
in telling you this now ... Geest
technology has taken somewhat different
turns than our own. In their
weapons they employ traces of certain
elements which we are only beginning
to learn to maintain in stable
form. That is a matter your government
has kept from public knowledge
because we don't wish the Geests to
learn from human prisoners how
much information we are gaining
from them.</p>

<p>"The instrument which made this
copy naturally did not have such elements
at its disposal. So it employed
their lower homologues and in that
manner successfully produced an almost
identical model. In fact, the only
significant difference is that such a
gun, if it had been a complete model,
could not possibly have been fired."
He smiled briefly. "But that, I think
you will agree, <i>is</i> a significant difference!
We knew as soon as the so-called
Geest gun was examined that it
could only have been made by human
beings."</p>

<p>"Then," Commissioner Sanford
said soberly, "its apparent discovery
on Roye during our visit was a deliberate
hoax&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cranehart nodded. "Of course."</p>

<p>Ronald Black said, "I fail to see
why you've kept this quiet. You needn't
have given away any secrets.
Meanwhile the wave of public criticism
at the government's seeming
hesitancy to take action on the discovery&mdash;that
is, to rush protection to
the threatened Territorial Segments&mdash;has
reached almost alarming proportions.
You could have stopped it
before it began two months ago with
a single announcement."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," Cranehart said. "There
were other considerations. Incidentally,
Mr. Black, we are not unappreciative
of the fact that the news media
under your own control exercised a
generous restraint in the matter."</p>

<p>"For which," Black said dryly, "I am
now very thankful."</p>

<p>"As for the others," Cranehart went
on, "the government has survived periods
of criticism before. That is not
important. The important thing is
that the Geest War has been with us
for more than a human life span now
... and it becomes difficult for
many to bear in mind that until its
conclusion no acts that might reduce
our ability to prosecute it can be
tolerated."</p>

<p>Ronald Black said slowly, "So
you've been delaying the announcement
until you could find out who
was responsible for the hoax."</p>

<p>"We were interested," Cranehart
said, "only in the important men&mdash;the
dangerous men. We don't care
much who else is guilty of what. This,
you see, is a matter of expediency, not
of justice." He looked for a moment
at the politely questioning, somewhat
puzzled faces across the desk, went
on, "When you leave this room, each
of you will be conducted to an office
where you will be given certain papers
to sign. That is the first
step."</p>

<hr />

<p>There was silence for some seconds.
Ronald Black took a cigarette
from a platinum case, tapped it gently
on the desk, put it to his mouth
and lit it. Cranehart went on, "It
would have been impossible to unravel
this particular conspiracy if the
forgery had been immediately exposed.
At that time, no one had taken
any obvious action. Then, within a
few days&mdash;with the discovery apparently
confirmed by our silence&mdash;normal
maneuverings in industry and
finance were observed to be under
way. If a major shift in war policy was
pending, if one or more key bases
were to be established in Territorial
Segments previously considered beyond
the range of Geest reconnaissance
and therefore secure from attack,
this would be to somebody's
benefit on Earth."</p>

<p>"Isn't it always?" Black murmured.</p>

<p>"Of course. It's a normal procedure,
ordinarily of no concern to
government.
It can be predicted
with considerable accuracy to
what group or groups the ultimate advantage
in such a situation will go.
But in these past weeks, it became
apparent that somebody else was winning
out ... somebody who could
have won out only on the basis of
careful and extensive preparation for
this very situation.</p>

<p>"That was abnormal, and it was the
appearance of an abnormal pattern
for which we had been waiting. We
find there are seven men involved.
These men will be deprived of the
advantage they have gained."</p>

<p>Ronald Black shook his head, said,
"You're making a mistake, Cranehart.
I'm signing no papers."</p>

<p>"Nor I," Sanford said thickly.</p>

<p>Cranehart rubbed the side of his
nose with a fingertip, said meditatively,
"You won't be forced to. Not
directly." He nodded at the window.
"On the landing flange out there is an
aircar. It is possible that this aircar
will be found wrecked in the mountains
some four hundred miles north
of here early tomorrow morning.
Naturally, we have a satisfactory
story prepared to cover such an eventuality."</p>

<p>Sanford whitened slowly. He said,
"So you'd resort to murder!"</p>

<p>Cranehart was silent for a few seconds.
"Mr. Sanford," he said then,
"you, as a member of the Territorial
Office, know very well that the Geest
War has consumed over four hundred
million human lives to date.
That is the circumstance which obliges
your government to insist on
your co-operation. I advise you to
give it."</p>

<p>"But you have no proof! You have
nothing but surmises&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Consider this," Cranehart said. "A
conspiracy of the type I have described
constitutes a capital offense
under present conditions. Are you
certain that you would prefer us to
continue to look for proof?"</p>

<p>Ronald Black said in a harsh voice,
"And what would the outcome be if
we did choose to co-operate?"</p>

<p>"Well, we can't afford to leave men
of your type in a position of influence,
Mr. Black," Cranehart said amiably.
"And you understand, I'm sure,
that it would be entirely too difficult
to keep you under proper surveillance
on Earth&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Celia Adams said from outside the
cabin door, "I think it is them, Phil.
Both cars have started to circle."</p>

<p>Phil Boles came to the door behind
her and looked up. It was early
evening&mdash;Roye's sun just down, and
a few stars out. The sky above the sea
was still light. After a moment, he
made out the two aircars moving in a
wide, slow arc far overhead. He
glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes late," he remarked.
"But it couldn't be anyone
else. And if they hadn't all come
along, they wouldn't have needed two
cars." He hesitated. "We can't tell
how they're going to take this, Celia,
but they may have decided already
that they could make out better without
us." He nodded towards the edge
of the cliff. "Short way over there, and
a long drop to the water! So don't let
them surprise you."</p>

<p>She said coldly, "I won't. And I've
used guns before this."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't doubt it." Phil reached
back behind the door, picked up a
flarelight standing beside a heavy
machine rifle, and came outside. He
pointed the light at the cars and
touched the flash button briefly three
times. After a moment, there were
two answering flashes from the leading
car.</p>

<p>"So Wayne Jackson's in the front
car," Phil said. "Now let's see what
they do." He returned the light to its
place behind the door and came out
again, standing about twelve feet to
one side of Celia. The aircars vanished
inland, came back at treetop
level a few minutes later. One settled
down quietly between the cabin and
the edge of the cliff, the other following
but dropping to the ground a
hundred yards away, where it stopped.
Phil glanced over at Celia, said softly,
"Watch that one!" She nodded almost
imperceptibly, right hand buried
in her jacket pocket.</p>

<p>The near door of the car before
them opened. Major Wayne Jackson,
hatless and in hunting clothes,
climbed out, staring at them. He
said, "Anyone else here?"</p>

<p>"Just Celia and myself," Phil said.</p>

<p>Jackson turned, spoke into the car
and two men, similarly dressed, came
out behind him. Phil recognized Ronald
Black and Sanford. The three
started over to the cabin, stopped a
dozen feet away.</p>

<p>Jackson said sardonically, "Our five
other previous Earthside partners are
in the second car. In spite of your insistence
to meet the whole group,
they don't want you and Celia to see
their faces. They don't wish to be
identifiable." He touched his coat lapel.
"They'll hear what we're saying
over this communicator and they
could talk to you, but won't unless
they feel it's necessary. You'll have to
take my word for it that we're all
present."</p>

<p>"That's good enough," Phil said.</p>

<p>"All right," Jackson went on, "now
what did you mean by forcing us to
take this chance? Let me make it
plain. Colonel Thayer hasn't been accused
of collaborating in the Roye
gun hoax, but he got a black eye out
of the affair just the same. And don't
forget that a planet with colonial status
is technically under martial law,
which includes the civilians. If Silas
Thayer can get his hands on the guilty
persons, the situation will become
a lot more unpleasant than it already
is."</p>

<hr />

<p>Phil addressed Ronald Black,
"Then how about you two? When
you showed up here again on a transfer
list, Thayer must have guessed
why."</p>

<p>Black shook his head. "Both of us
exercised the privilege of changing
our names just prior to the outtransfer.
He doesn't know we're on Roye.
We don't intend to let him find out."</p>

<p>Phil asked, "Did you make any arrangements
to get out of Roye
again?"</p>

<p>"Before leaving Earth?" Black
showed his teeth in a humorless smile.
"Boles, you have no idea of how
abruptly and completely the government
men cut us off from our every
resource! We were given no opportunity
to draw up plans to escape
from exile, believe me."</p>

<p>Phil glanced over at Celia. "In that
case," he said, a little thickly, "we'd
better see if we can't draw some up
together immediately."</p>

<p>Jackson asked, staring, "What are
you talking about, Phil? Don't think
for a moment Silas Thayer isn't doing
what he can to find out who put that
trick over on him. I'm not at all sure
he doesn't suspect me. And if he can
tie it to us, it's our neck. If you have
some crazy idea of getting off the
planet now, let me tell you that for
the next few years we can't risk making
a single move! If we stay quiet,
we're safe. We&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think we'd be safe," Phil
said.</p>

<p>On his right, Celia Adams added
sharply, "The gentleman in the other
car who's just started to lower that
window had better raise it again! If
he's got good eyesight, he'll see I
have a gun pointed at him. Yes, that's
much better! Go on, Phil."</p>

<p>"Have you both gone out of your
minds?" Jackson demanded.</p>

<p>"No," Celia said. She laughed with
a sudden shakiness in her tone, added,
"Though I don't know why we haven't!
We've thought of the possibility
that the rest of you might feel it
would be better if Phil and I weren't
around any more, Wayne."</p>

<p>"That's nonsense!" Jackson said.</p>

<p>"Maybe. Anyway, don't try it. You
wouldn't be doing yourselves a favor
even if it worked. Better listen now."</p>

<p>"Listen to what?" Jackson demanded
exasperatedly. "I'm telling
you it will be all right, if we just don't
make any mistakes. The only real
pieces of evidence were your duplicator
and the original gun. Since we're
rid of those&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're not rid of the gun, Wayne,"
Phil said. "I still have it. I haven't
dared get rid of it."</p>

<p>"You ... what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I was with Beulah in the Fort
Roye hospital when she died," Phil
said. He added to Ronald Black,
"That was two days after the ship
brought the seven of you in."</p>

<p>Black nodded, his eyes alert. "Major
Jackson informed me."</p>

<p>"She was very weak, of course, but
quite lucid," Phil went on. "She
talked a good deal&mdash;reminiscing, and
in a rather happy vein. She finally
mentioned the Geest gun, and how
Uncle William used to keep us boys
... Wayne and me ... spell-bound
with stories about the Gunderland
Battle, and how he'd picked the
gun up there."</p>

<p>Jackson began, "And what does&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He didn't get the gun there," Phil
said. "Beulah said Uncle William
came in from Earth with the first
shipment of settlers and was never off
Roye again in his life."</p>

<p>"He ... then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Phil said, "Don't you get it? He
found the gun right here on Roye.
Beulah thought it was awfully funny.
William was an old fool, she said, but
the best liar she'd ever known. He
came in with the thing one day after
he'd been traipsing around the back
country, and said it looked 'sort of'
like pictures of Geest guns he'd seen,
and that he was going to put the inscription
on it and have some fun
now and then." Phil took a deep
breath. "Uncle William found it lying
in a pile of ashes where someone had
made camp a few days before. He
figured it would have been a planetary
speedster some rich sportsmen
from Earth had brought in for a taste
of outworld hunting on Roye, and
that one of them had dumped the
broken oddball gun into the fire to
get rid of it.</p>

<p>"That was thirty-six years ago. Beulah
remembered it happened a year
before I was born."</p>

<p>There was silence for some seconds.
Then Ronald Black said evenly,
"And what do you conclude, Boles?"</p>

<p>Phil looked at him. "I'd conclude
that Norm Vaughn was right about
there having been some fairly intelligent
creatures here once. The Geests
ran into them and exterminated them
as they usually do. That might have
been a couple of centuries back.
Then, thirty-six years ago, one of
their scouts slipped in here without
being spotted, found human beings
on the planet, looked around a little
and left again."</p>

<p>He took the Geest gun from his
pocket, hefted it in his hand. "We
have the evidence here," he said. "We
had it all the time and didn't know
it."</p>

<p>Ronald Black said dryly, "We may
have the evidence. But we have no
slightest proof at all now that that's
what it is."</p>

<p>"I know it," Phil said. "Now Beulah's
gone ... well, we couldn't
even prove that William Boles never
left the planet, for that matter. There
weren't any records to speak of being
kept in the early days." He was silent
a moment. "Supposing," he said, "we
went ahead anyway. We hand the
gun in, with the story I just told
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jackson made a harsh, laughing
sound. "That would hang us fast,
Phil!"</p>

<p>"And nothing else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else," Black said with
finality. "Why should anyone believe
the story now? There are a hundred
more likely ways in which a Geest
gun could have got to Roye. The gun
is tangible evidence of the hoax, but
that's all."</p>

<p>Phil asked, "Does anybody ...
including the cautious gentlemen in
the car over there ... disagree with
that?"</p>

<p>There was silence again. Phil
shrugged, turned towards the cliff
edge, drew his arm back and hurled
the Geest gun far up and out above
the sea. Still without speaking, the
others turned their heads to watch it
fall towards the water, then looked
back at him.</p>

<p>"I didn't think very much of that
possibility myself," Phil said unsteadily.
"But one of you might have.
All right&mdash;<i>we</i> know the Geests know
we're here. But we won't be able to
convince anyone else of it. And,
these last few years, the war seems to
have been slowing down again. In
the past, that's always meant the
Geests were preparing a big new
surprise operation.</p>

<p>"So the other thing now&mdash;the business
of getting off Roye. It can't be
done unless some of you have made
prior arrangements for it Earthside. If
it had been possible in any other way,
I'd have been out of this place ten
years ago."</p>

<p>Ronald Black said carefully, "Very
unfortunately, Boles, no such arrangements
have been made."</p>

<p>"Then there it is," Phil said. "I
suppose you see now why I thought
this group should get together. The
ten masterminds! Well, we've hoaxed
ourselves into a massive jam. Now
let's find out if there's any possible
way&mdash;<i>any possibility at all!</i>&mdash;of getting
out of it again."</p>

<p>A voice spoke tinnily from Jackson's
lapel communicator. "Major
Jackson?"</p>

<p>"Yes?" Jackson said.</p>

<p>"Please persuade Miss Adams that
it is no longer necessary to point her
gun at this car. In view of the stated
emergency, we feel we had better
come out now&mdash;and join the conference."</p>

<hr />

<p>FROM THE RECORDS OF THE
TERRITORIAL OFFICE, 2345 A.D.</p>

<p>... It is generally acknowledged
that the Campaign of the 132nd Segment
marked the turning point of
the Geest War. Following the retransfer
of Colonel Silas Thayer to Earth,
the inspired leadership of Major
Wayne Jackson and his indefatigable
and exceptionally able assistants, notably
CLU President Boles, transformed
the technically unfortified
and thinly settled key world of Roye
within twelve years into a virtual
death trap for any invading force. Almost
half of the Geest fleet which
eventually arrived there was destroyed
in the first week subsequent
to the landing, and few of the remaining
ships were sufficiently undamaged
to be able to lift again. The
enemy relief fleet, comprising an estimated
forty per cent of the surviving
Geest space power, was intercepted
in the 134th Segment by the
